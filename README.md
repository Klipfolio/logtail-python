# Fork Comments

This is a fork of Better Stack's logtail-python repo.  It adds functionality similar to `handler.context()`, except it allows custom properties to be added at the top level of the log JSON.

So instead of saying `handler.context(program={'name': 'transmogrifier'})`, you simply say `handler.staticProps={'name': 'transmogrifier'}`.  The difference is that now, it is easier to search: Instead of searching on `context.program.name=transmogrifier`, you can simply search on `name=transmogrifier`.  This was done to reproduce the program name functionality in Papertrail / SWO.
